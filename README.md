# hnefatafl
Hnefatafl is an ancient Viking strategy board game. There are two teams- an attacking team and a defending team. The attacking team tries to capture the other team's king, whereas the defending team tries to get their king to one of the corners of the board.

#Rules of the Game

The game is played on an 11x11 board, and the initial layout is shown above. The attacking team starts first.

Every piece can move in the same way- just like a rook in chess. They can move horizontally or vertically as far as they want, but they cannot jump over any other pieces. The king is the only piece that can move *onto* the center and corner tiles, but all of the other pieces can move *through* the center tile.

Players can capture their opponents pieces by sandwiching an opponents piece. The center and corners are considered hostile territory, so they can be used to sandwich/capture an opponent. For instance, if the defending player moves their piece such that they sandwich an attacking piece between their piece and the corner, then the attacking piece is removed from the board.

The king is captured when is is enclosed on all four sides.
